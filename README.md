Overview
This project aims to revolutionize traditional farming methods by leveraging AI to optimize crop monitoring, irrigation, and fertilization. Traditional farming faces challenges such as low productivity, high wastage, and inconsistent yields, exacerbated by climate unpredictability and inefficient resource utilization. This solution addresses these challenges by integrating real-time AI-based monitoring, smart irrigation, and fertilization.

Features
-> Automated Crop Monitoring: Use of AI-based image recognition to detect pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies in crops in real-time.
-> Smart Irrigation & Fertilization: AI-powered recommendations to optimize water and fertilizer usage based on weather data, soil analysis, and crop needs.
-> Climate Adaptability: Real-time monitoring and adjustments based on local weather conditions and climate changes.
-> Data-Driven Insights: Provides farmers with actionable insights through dashboards and reports to maximize productivity and minimize costs.
-> Environmental Impact Reduction: Reduces fertilizer and water wastage, minimizing the environmental impact of farming practices.
